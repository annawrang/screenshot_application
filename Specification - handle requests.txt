To handle up to 1 000 000 requests per day my solution would need to be changed to an API
that gets screenshots from urls without having to open up a new window (something like 
Selenium WebDriver).
The database (which is just a local database now) would be placed on the cloud, maybe
Amazon Cloud. There might also be a better online service to store the pictures which
is designed for images.
The exception handling would need to be much more specific, right now it just covers the 
very basics.
The server would also need to be placed somewhere else than on someones personal computer.
It could also help if the server class was a Thread.
